# AWS-Serverless-Deployment
This project shows how to deploy a Python 3.12 AWS Lambda function using Docker and the Serverless Framework on Windows 11. It uses Docker Buildx for Linux/AMD64 compatibility, packages code with the Lambda base image, and exposes it via API Gateway, providing a repeatable workflow for serverless deployments.
